Procedural PHP 7 using mysqli

You need to create a db_credentials.php from db_credentials_template.php to provide your own database credentials.
Please also adapt the "SUPPORT_EMAIL" in configuration.php

Database tested: MariaDB 10

The version in Master is working fine.

## Version 2
There will probably be a new version (object oriented PHP 7 with PDO), but I can't tell you when that project will start.
